Geodesic distance and triangulation
https://drive.google.com/open?id=11K8rVG3lTxP8OFn3r2VS26tLc-s4Ka-e

Both can be tested with project, that compiles on Windows.
Main file for testing is source\Scene.cpp

# Future release
It is planned to develop complete rendering engine with three modules for the next release:
<ol>
<li>Graphics 2d API</li>
<li>Customized text layout</li>
<li>User interface components</li>
</ol>
for Windows and Android platforms.
